### What is a webcast platform used for?

A webcasting platform is a type of software which serves the purposes of publishing webcasting channels, managing webcast events and promoting channels and events with a web campaign. The most popular platforms come from large american companies such as UStream, LiveStream and YouTube. They offer free, publicly-available channels in return for branding and integrating the channel into their content interface. This creates an environment where the viewer is invited to visit other contents and engage with the different brands sponsoring the platform provider. Even “premium” channels, offered to corporate users, are required to use this usage template.

In order to build a webcast site solely dedicated to an organization or event, we must rely on website content management software (CMS). The most popular of these CMS is without a doubt WordPress, which a vast number of organizations already deploy for their main website. It is from that base possible, by combining the embeddable features of the large streaming providers with a WordPress site, to produce a standalone webcasting event. This does not make the most elegant solution, however, as WordPress was fundamentally designed for blogging management, and its many plugins soon become expensive to acquire and maintain.

> In order to build a webcast site solely dedicated to an organization or event, we must rely on website content management software (CMS).

The option we chose is the Drupal CMS, a WordPress competitor in web content management which has many more features and smoother extensibility through a large suite of fully free and open modules. However, Drupal is know to be harder to use than WordPress, which is why we have customized it to our own specification in order to transform it into an easy to adopt and complete webcasting platform: **Drupal Webcasting**. We can, with this platform, launch, build and host a standalone webcast website, using your custom domain or subdomain (mywebcast.example.com), at a radically lower cost than what web design agencies must quote for an ordinary WordPress or Drupal project.

### Is the webcasting site easy to administer? Easy to launch? Easy to maintain?

With your site provisioned at the kickoff meeting for your event, you can immediately have access to edit contents, with full WYSIWYG editor, to create and administer users and to create channels.

Since we host our platform on the Aegir hosting system for Drupal, provisioning a new site is a matter of minutes. Ten more minutes to set up your channels and the webcast is ready to be promoted to your viewers.

Your site’s maintenance is automatically managed by this hosting system, and does not create any additional costs.

### How easy it is to produce a webcasting site? Who manages contents? Who manages the live webcast video content?

Even with an easy software platform fully customized for webcasting events, producing a webcasting site requires effort which scales in comparison to the scope of the event. The more ambitious your event, the higher your viewers’ expectations of descriptive content will be. You may also need a graphic theme which can be as simple as a logo and some colors, up to a complete graphical branding based on the event’s sponsor. In general, the fewer changes are made to the layout, the easier a theming project will be.

Content editing before, during and after a live event can be performed by a member of a production team (generally speaking, the production manager) or a member of your organization that has up-to-date knowledge of the event schedule.

Our technicians are trained to use the platform and require no additional preparation before a live event. They handle the distribution of live webcast channels and recorded videos with their own limited access permissions to the site.

### Can we capture and export questions and questionnaires for a webcast?

A popular interactive feature for webcasts is a question submission form, which the webcast participants use to invite viewers to interact with them, to evaluate their level of satisfaction with the webcast, or for other communication.

In order to have the most versatile solution to this problem, we have integrated to our platform the Drupal Webform module, which provides you with a simple interface to build questionnaires, to export them to a spreadsheet such as excel or an external database, and to integrate the form to a live webcast page with a modal window that does not interrupt viewing.

Forms can also send their responses to your email, and notify you immediately of a question before or after a webcast. It is an easy and simple way to create a feeling of being participants for your viewers.

### How can we control access to the webcast? What kind of access control templates are available? Are they difficult to manage?
Comment peut-on contrôler qui a accès à la webdiffusion? Quels sont les modèles de droits d'accès disponibles? Sont-ils compliqués à gérer?

Most organizations need to limit access to their webcast contents, for reasons as diverse as that information is exclusive to members, that the content is sold as a package, or that information must be collected from viewers first.

This is where Drupal provides the most flexibility. While large platforms or WordPress have fixed permission templates, Drupal is designed for managing users with multiple roles and rights. It is therefore very simple to build a permission system customized for your event or series of events.

You can, for instance, collect personal contact information from your viewers in exchange for granting them access to the wrbcast. You can also create user groups and have your sales team sell them subscriptions (they can directly arrange users into groups).

<!--![](http://placehold.it/960x540&text=Screenflow+drois+acces)-->

Last but not least, Drupal features a complete suite of free and open e-commerce modules, which as easily integrated to any webcasting model in order to transform your event or channel into a revenue generator for your organization.

All these available means imply complexity at the planning stage, but are easy to use once the right choice is made. Our webcast producer will help you select your site's access control model during the strategy phase of your production.

### Will my videos be available on the webcast website after the live webcast? What does archiving video cost?

Video content has a value which depreciates at a rate related to its relevance. A press conference, a sport event or a product launch are interesting because of the news they provide, and are not really worth watching the next day. On the other hand, some speakers and training webcasts will provide an interesting topic for many years, and we have noticed that this type of content provides a solid base to build the promotional campaign for the next edition of the event. For this reason, Drupal Webcasting's archive channels are design with the same attention as the live channels, and our technicians are able to publish video-on-demand content to them in less than 24 hours after the live event's conclusion. The webcast site transformes into an archive channel, and is ready to be reactivated as a promotional campaign for your next event.

Generally, the cost of video-on-demand channels is part of your live webcasting package, which can do through the use of the most efficient cloud content-distribution network, Amazon CloudFront.

### Can my webcast site be used to promote my event? What are they key features of webcast event promotion?

A webcasting event is a major investment, both for organizations whose earn membership fees as for sponsors who want to create awareness for their brand. Content achieves its potential value only if it attracts interested viewers, and attracting those viewers means setting up a promotional campaign.

Building this campaign can take place on many channels. Mass emailing, social media viral posts, combined with a website describing the event, sometimes with clips embedded from YouTube or some random format, all the pieces of this campaign are disconnected and some are typically sacrificed to make managing the campaign easier.

> Content achieves its potential value only if it attracts interested viewers, and attracting those viewers means setting up a promotional campaign.

Our solution to this problem is to integrate the promotional campaign with the webcasting site. It is easy to not only provide descriptive information about the event (who the speakers are, the sponsors, the key feature, the schedule, etc.), but also to relate this information to archived content, to create sign-up pages that collect important contact information from your viewers and allow you to send reminder emails the day before the event, or whatever other content or web interaction flow that contributes to promote your event.

### How do I make my live webcast more interactive? How do I gather comments? Surveys? A Twitter hashtag?

A webcast is different from a broadcast because of its interactive feature. Viewers are attracted to the event by the possibility of being participants, by having influence over the content to the same extent as if they were only a few seats from the main stage.

Que souhaite-t-on faire lors d’un événement en salle? On souhaite poser nos questions aux conférenciers, ou converser avec nos voisins sur les sujets en cours. Cette forme de participation retrouve son penchant web par la conversation Twitter, très simple à intégrer à un site de webdiffusion, ou bien un fil de commentaires style « blogue ». Un formulaire pour envoyer instantanément et anonymement une question au conférencier peut être intégré à la page de diffusion en direct.

What is it that we wish to do during a live event? We want to ask questions to the speakers, or discuss with our fellow attendees

<!--![](http://placehold.it/960x540&text=Screenflow+formulaire)-->

Speakers sometime want to involve the audience in original activities. To support this on the web, we go as far as developing custom interaction widgets, structured in a webcasting project.

### Will my visitors succeed in connecting to the webcast? Is there any support we can provide them if their system is incompatible? How do we ensure no one misses the live webcast?

The timeliness of a live webcast event creates stress for interested viewers. What to do if, at the start of the live webcast, they cannot successfully connect? How could they prepare or remember to arrive early in order to set up all the parameters of their device for an optimal experience?

The ideal solution to this problem is to use a universal technology, one that works immediately on all devices. Unfortunately, the computer industry has not achieved this harmony yet, and many competing technologies exist for streaming live video. The second best solution is to use the most widespread technologies, which means the Flash Player plugin on PCs and the HLS protocol for iPhone, iPad and other mobile devices.

![Webcasting to iPad is increasingly important in 2014](/images/diffusion-sur-ipad-groupe.jpg)
*Webcasting to iPad is increasingly important in 2014*

The viewer is therefore required to verify that his device is properly configured for either one of these technologies, and if it is not, the viewer must install and configure them, or worse yet, open a support ticket with his employer's IT staff.

In order to make this step as painless as possible, we have added to the Drupal Webcasting platform a technical support page that runs a battery of interactive tests and shows the relevant solutions to the failing tests. This page can be available immediately at the launch of the promotional campaign for your event. Viewers are therefore warned in advance of technical requirements and can confidently plan for the device they will use to participate during the live webcast.

<!--![](http://placehold.it/960x540&text=Screenflow+page+test)-->

Despite all those solutions, some users are still unable to connect during a live webcast. Stress over missing the start of the content compounds the stress of using new technolies. We recommend, when sufficient budget is available, to add a technical support helpline with experience technicians to guide viewers quickly and expediently to a solution for watching the webcast.

The last frequent problem is simply forgetting, because of their busy schedule, at what date and time the webcast is to take place. A simple reminder email, 24 hours or less before the event kickoff, is a nice perk. You can send reminder emails from within the platform or use a mass emailing service such as MailChimp to convert visitors into subscribers.

### Where do you get your web technology? How modern is it? How reliable is it? Can you provide long-term support? Will you continue developing your platform?

The web is constantly evolving, and so are the technologies necessary to engage with it. The most common risk facing a website and its platform isn't wear and tear, it is obsolescence. The day that the ecosystem within which a website operates leaves it behind is always arriving faster, and every website must keep itself up-to-date just to keep its place in mindshare.

To make this work, a website's underlying technology must be continuously upgraded, and developing those upgrades increases in cost as the technology becomes more complex and sophisticated. For this reason, we chose to build our platform on Drupal software, now in its 7th version and the 8th being prepared. We gain the advantage of having permanently up-to-date core modules thanks to the work of a community of tens of thousands of developers working around the world on its updates. By building a webcasting experience on software which has the industry-leading velocity in innovation, we can rest assured that our experience will be the best year-after-year, and will easily grow into the next web innovations.

There is an obvious advantage in not reinventing the wheel. There is a subtle advantage in not reinventing and evolving invention - we have the benefit of rapidly integrating its emerging improvements.

### Will my webcast be locked into your platform? Do I need a web server to host my webcast? Can I build out my site as my event grows?

Using free and open software such as Drupal provides many advantages, but also some inconveniences. The main one is that the software requires a server and server administrator, which is not the case for software-as-a-service platforms such as YouTube. On the other hand, when we opt to provide our own hosting, we gain the option to add our own feature modules to our site.

What is the best option for an organisation which is making a long-term investment in webcasting? Either accept the constraints of the proprietary platforms, or suffer the pains of managing software and hosting. To break this dilemma, we set up our own hosting system using [Aegir for Drupal](http://www.aegirproject.org/) technology. This allows us to spread out the costs of managing a large number of webcasting websites and to quickly provision and launch new projects. In addition, since the software is free and open, you have the option to migrate a webcast's website data to a different hosting system of your choice when your project grows in scope, et you can then take advantage of the vast international and local networks of Drupal service providers.

### Can the Drupal Webcasting platform be used to build a complex webcast? Including online payments? Custom features? Using our external database?

Is your webcast a project that is critical to the life of your organisation? For many of you, you are experimenting with webcasting at this time, but if you make regular investments in webcasting your organisation could come to depend upon it more and more. In such a situation, it is preferable to control your own webcasting platform and not to depend on commercial platforms, which can change their feature set and pricing without warning.

This is the challenge our company faces, and since our mission is to help other organisations grow with webcasting, we anticipate that many of you will one day face this situation. This is why we open the path of growth through [the webcasting project](project.html).

It is possible to design and build a vast range of expansion modules which can integrate into Drupal Webcasting. Integrating and syncronizing data with an organisation's database is one common example. Another example would be creating a custom business model with the Drupal Commerce system. There may a type of content or interaction that is unique to your operations that you would like to add to your site. All of these problems can find a solution through a webcasting project.

Because all Drupal modules are GPL licensed, and software written to extend Drupal is automatically free and open, and you have the freedom to do with it as you please, whatever path our main webcasting platform or hosting service ends up taking.

If you are expecting an unusually large volume of visitors, or do not wish for your site's performance to suffer interference from neighboring sites on the server, you can your webcast on a VIP hosting service, such as [Pantheon](http://getpantheon.com) or [Acquia Cloud](http://acquia.com), using your own account. We will help you through the hosting process and provide support.

Drupal Webcasting helps organisations starting out in webcasting to resolve two critical problems, at first managing and administering complex web publishing software, and later on being locked-in to a particular provider.

### How do mobile devices adapt to our webcast website? How do we reach an iPad audience?

More and more web traffic comes from mobile computers, such as smartphones (iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, etc), tablets (iPad, Galaxy Tab, Kindle) or a diversity of other impossible to name clones. Adding even more complexity is the fact that some viewers multi-browse, jumping from one device to another in order to use a website, for example by opening a social media link on their phone, doing a quick browse, then opening the site in a desktop browser to finish their visit. Some users even use a website on multiple devices *simultaneously*, in order to enjoy multiple perspectives.

Today it is almost impossible to detect in what context a website will be visited, and so it is pointless to design and define content for a single device. Legacy web platforms dating from before the mobile revolution struggle to contort themselves into the device formats that their users now expect, prisonners that they are of assumptions that seemed reasonable when they were first designed.

![iPad webcasting can be enjoyed in a wide range of contexts](/images/diffusion-sur-ipad.jpg)
*iPad webcasting can be enjoyed in a wide range of contexts*

Drupal Webcasting is a platform that moves with the current, using a design approach called *[mobile-first responsive web design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design)*, which involves designing for a mobile experience first and then enhancing it with richer detail when the larger context makes it possible to better exploit content. This results in a webcast experience that is fundamentally multidevice, that can be enjoyed as well on a couch or in an office or at the local coffee shop, thus ensuring that the reach of your event extends to the largest possible audience and their largest possible expectations.
