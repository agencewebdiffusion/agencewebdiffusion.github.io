# About Projects

Any company or organization has its own peculiarities. These peculiarities inevitably create peculiar problems that make it impossible to deploy mass-market solutions to resolve. This means that a custom-tailored solution is needed, and therefore a good tailor is needed as well.

*Agence Webdiffusion* designs and develops its own equipement and software in order to achieve the maximum potential of webcasting and to exploit the talents of its associates. Our design skills are offered to our clients as part of a project.

A project can produce a result of many forms, for instance:

- a large-scale webcasting event involving ambiguous risks,
- an automated recording and streaming system for classrooms,
- a content-marketing system that integrates video capsules with a mobile web application for sales associates,<a id="demarche"></a>
- an extension module for Drupal Webcasting that adds a new feature,
- etc.

#### Categories of Projects

There exists four categories of projects in web design. They follow or iterate one-another in order to achieve a preliminary objective, or to resolve a particular problem.

When starting a project based on a hypothesis (*a webcast event will improve the efficiency of my sales team*, for example), it is necessary to through all four categories in logical order. First, start a *research* project to define the problem statement and verify the hypothesis. Second, a *design* project defines the vision for the solution that is to be built, followed by a *development* project to build and assemble the parts of this vision. Finally, an *integration* project validates that the solution that was created works as planned within the production environment.

Let's look at all of these project types, starting from the smallest to the largest. This means going through the list in reverse.

### The Integration Project

<!--![](http://placehold.it/960x540&text=Diagramme+integration)-->

An integration project means validating the use of equipement and software within a production environment. For example, will purchasing multiple cameras and an encoding computer provide a sufficiently powerful system to record your next conference event? To be perfectly sure we are ready for this event, we need to *integrate* this system with test content, and calibrate the result by observing the system's performance and tweaking the configuration.

An integration project is required when the current priority is eliminating remaining risks from known solutions. Running tests in the work environment itself, with all of its peculiarities, is the only way to have the peace mind of a predictable process.

When we work for your integration project, our teams travel to your production environment, either the shoot location or your offices, to install the system tools and run user tests. This way we can ensure that your software and technical platform is guaranteed to work when production is set to launch.

### The Development Project

<!--![](http://placehold.it/960x540&text=Screenflow+code)-->

A development project involves building a unique technological solution to a problem or need. If available technologies are insufficient, inelegant, too expensive or too complicated, developing a custom solution can be the best solution.

In webcasting a custom solution takes the shape of an interaction module, a mobile or local computer system, a camera network linked to a streaming system, etc. Developing a new solution is by nature *innovation*, a new way of solving a problem using existing and reliable technologies but adding alterations, extensions or combinations.

Developing a solution is done in a laboratory (or simply an office), where conditions make it possible to control and solve for each variable in the system independently of all the others. The project makes progress, from one attempt to the next, by assimilating results from failed atempts in order to arrive at a working final solution.

When tools and equipments needed for your production are nonexistant, our teams are able to assemble them for you. We use cloud computing platforms and open source software in order to provide you total ownership of the solution. The end result will be a software and video platform custom-made for your particular problem statement.

### The Design Project

<!--![](http://placehold.it/960x540&text=Diagramme+conception)-->

To design a solution means translating a list of goals and problems into models that can then be built by developers. Design searches through the largest possible number of models as quickly as possible and test them against the problem statement in order to prevent wasted development time on useless or overcomplicated features. A design product is therefore a key factor in a development project. A badly designed solution, no matter how well built, will not help solve the problem. Without any concept to start with, a development project will come to a sudden halt when faced with the ambiguity of the required solution.

Design tools are many and all claim to be the generator of creative genius. For webcasting, design can be done with very simple wireframes and schematics, showing which parts are to be included in the system and what roles they take. The simpler the tool, the simpler the project will end up being, and if a design can expressed on a single sheet of paper, all the better.

A simple project is distinguishable from a complex project by the number of models that need to be created before a good, actionable solution is defined. There may be times when a solution is found right away, while others where many iterations and brainstorms and looking at other examples for models are needed before a solution can be found.

### Research Projects

<!--![](http://placehold.it/960x540&text=Diagramme+recherche)-->

If no amount of brainstorming or searching can help find a solution, it probably means the problem itself is not sufficiently understood. In this case, the best way to eliminate waste and effort is to gather more information.

A research project involves investigating your organisation to surface every dimension of your problem or goal, which means what problems or goals every individual has in mind, as well as what contents are to be produced, what potentials are to be exploited, etc.

There are different types of research in a research project, which are picked based on the kinds of questions we are facing and what hypothesis is being proposed. According to the web research guide [Just Enough Research](http://www.abookapart.com/products/just-enough-research) there are four main axis of research:

- Organisational research answers questions about the organisation, such as what are its touch points with customers, what workflows it uses, what performance indicators it follows, what are its hierarchies, etc. Organisational research determines a project's goals, key performance indicators and impacts the project will have on the organisation, including what resources and people will be affected.
  Organisation research is conducted through interviews with key individuals, observation of operational workflows and reading internal documentation. This results in a project target that all stakeholders agree upon.
- User research answers questions about the users of a proposed solution, which means what are their characteristics, how do they expect to use the solution, what challenges do they face, etc. This makes it possible to describe "personas" which will inform the solution that will be designed - fitting the solution to the users.
  Interviews are an important, but not major part of user research. It is more important to observe the user in his usage context (his office, a sales floor, etc) in order to have true insight into his use of the solution.
- Competitive research answers questions about available alternatives. How do users reach their goals without the proposed solution? How do they solve problems? A usability test on competing solution can give us insights into opportunities that aren't to be missed and the avoidable errors in our new solution.
- Evaluative research answers questions about existing solutions. Do they really achieve the goals set out for them? Including analytics (visits to the sites, A/B split testing), observing users while they use the solution validates the solution's performance and identifies shortcomings to resolve. This research allows us to prioritize improvements from the most beneficial to the least, and to improve the system's performance at a faster rate.

### What does a webcasting project cost?

<!--![](http://placehold.it/960x540&text=Diagramme+waterfall+agile)-->

Cost factors in a project are much more fluid than in a [production](production.html), where schedules are framed by the content and it is a simple matter to attach the necessary resources for each production unit and arrive at a solid cost estimate. A project, in its most general definition, is the pursuit of a goal carrying uncertainty. It can be very easy to achieve, or very complex.

The first thing we must do to get a basic portrait of the costs of a project is to gather a team of project managers who have experience with this type of problem and its known solutions. Choosing an experienced project manager eliminates a large number of uncertainties, and allows the project to be decomposed into concrete tasks. The least domain experience the project manager has, the less precise his task definition will be and the more resources will be consumed to search for a solution.

Estimating the work required per task in a project is as much art as it is science. When a task has a known, repeatable results, with known parameters, such as building a brick wall or producing a morning webcast, we can rely on what we know about the last such task to produce an estimate of how much work will be needed next time. This project estimate method is applied to all projects that do not contain an innovation componenent and is very efficient. A public request-for-proposal process requires this method in order to get the most economic price from the market, for instance.

What happens when the project is innovation-intensive? In software development, which consists 100% of innovative work (existing software costs nothing to reproduce, after all), estimation has a reputation for being either highly inaccurate or completely useless, and estimating errors have caused countless cost and schedule explosions, [sometimes even threatening the very survival of the sponsoring organisation](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/delivering_large-scale_it_projects_on_time_on_budget_and_on_value).

Why such a history of failure? Because the conversation between software developers and project managers does not go through a mutual understanding of the problem. Project managers are concerned about schedules, and software developers are concerned about conclusive results. What then happens when a project manager asks a developer if a task will be done by a fixed deadline? The software developer will often give a highly unscientific response - making [a comparison based on gut feeling to a similar task or project he has been involved in before](http://blog.hut8labs.com/no-deadlines-for-you.html), which becomes less relevant the more innovative a project is, and becomes even less relevant if the project is long and the developer is inexperienced.

In order to get through this misunderstanding, we need a project management methodology that reduces risks *on all sides* of the project. These methodologies are sometimes called "agile", "scrum", "kanban" or other, but they all have a point in common: they decompose unknown tasks into the smallest possible units of known tasks, and involve active client participation in selecting the task priorities.

Cost is therefore only one parameter to keep track of in your project. There is also scope of work, timelines and resources applied. Balancing all of these constraints is the role of project management.

### Project management

Given a schedule, resources, a scope and a budget, how do we organise work to reach the established goals? That is what a project manager must do.

The most important constraints for your project depends on the nature of your organisation. A startup business has fixed resources but an elastic budget, and will eagerly sacrifice scope in order to reach very tight deadlines at high velocity of work. An association or public service, on the other hand, must have very tight oversight of budgets, and may be more flexible with scope.

<!--![](http://placehold.it/960x540&text=Diagramme+gestion+de+projet)-->

Knowing your constraint priorities is essential to a successful project. In an innovative project, errors are inevitable. "Fail fast" is the buzzword, meaning that the least amount of effort must be applied to discover what is a mistake, reducing waste from innovation to the least possible.

The least wasteful way to conduct an innovative project is to go backwards through the four categories of projects, starting with every technology that can be immediately integrated, and thus validating those technologies up front. Once we have conclusive results from this integration, we can perform useful evaluative research and clarify our priorities over the next tasks.

If there is nothing left to integrate, this means that more development needs to be done. If nothing remains to be developed, more needs to be designed. If there is no certainty for design, more research is needed.

A project is usually bigger than one single operation, requiring a careful piloting of tasks over many phases in order to produce the results you need. This is the mandate of project management at *Agence Webdiffusion*.

We have understood that our clients production schedule is the most important priority and that, no matter what happens in a project, the production component must be a success. Technical and software projects always have a tendency to drift, which is our project managers have adopted an agile project management workflow of rapid integration.

Our workflow works like this:

- As part of your exploratory research phase, we identify and prioritise your goals to create project "stories" describing the vision and intents.
- Our team then determines project tasks on each story: what integration, development, design or additional research is needed.
- Our team gets to work in order to integrate the highest priority story as soon as possible, ensuring its deployment to production.
- Integration feedback returns to project managers and new stories and tasks are reprioritized.

This way your budget and schedules are *optimized* in a decision cycle that constrains the scope of any individual story. <a id="thematisation"/>

### The Theming Project

<!--![](http://placehold.it/960x540&text=Collage+theming)-->

Graphic design is a subtle type of project. It has an impact on all aspects of a website simultaneously, thanks to the cascading properties of the web design language CSS. Graphic design is therefore very fragile to changes in the underlying architecture of a website.

It is preferable for all contents, or a highly accurate model of the content, to be settled before graphic design work is initiated in a project. By using the [Drupal Webcasting platform](platform.html), we can integrate all contents and set up interactive components of a webcast event quickly, before involving a graphic designer in the project. The graphic designer then has a complete overview and frame for his work, with stable constraints from which he can create the theme with the most effective graphical propagation method.

<!--![](http://placehold.it/960x540&text=tableau+workflow+thematisation)-->

If the project has a very strict schedule, the graphic design work can be started early using a technique called [Style Tiles](http://styletil.es). This involves producing graphic design elements outside of context, to simply validate that they work together and faithfully express the brand of the event. Selected Style Tiles are later rapidly integrated to the finalized content at the last phase of the project.
