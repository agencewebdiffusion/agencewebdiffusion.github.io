# What is a webcast production?
<div class="waypoint-bg"  style="background-image: url(/images/bg-production.jpg)"></div>

We call webcast production the process of capturing, encoding, transmitting, streaming and publishing live video content for the web.

A complete webcast production needs all of the following components:
1. One or more cameras
2. A signal switching computer or dedicated video switching equipment
3. A computer that encodes and transmits a video stream
4. A local network connection with an onsite or cloud streaming server
5. A streaming server that transforms the video stream into multiple streaming channels
6. A website to access the webcast
7. A video player integrated to the website to connect to a streaming channel

It can be very stressful to gather and integrate all of those parts simultaneous and arrive at a successful live webcast event by the deadline. This is why we are sharing the lessons we learned about webcasting with you.

### What does webcasting cost? What types of production can we make for webcasts?

There is a wide scale of webcast production types, usually segmented by the number of expected viewers, starting from the smallest webinar to a large political announcement. The costs of webcasting scale accordingly. It is today possible to webcast local political meetings at high definition quality starting from 2500$, while webcasts which charge customers for content usually invest 7000$ or more per production days. Large webcasting events spanning multiple days and whose audience reaches the entire world reach budgets as high as 70 000$. When selecting what type of webcast to produce, it is important to properly target the kind of viewer and the presenters to feature in order to make solid production decisions.

*Agence Webdiffusion* is specialized in planning, organizing and managing webcast productions, and will accompany you during the entire process to ensure that the right resources are in the right place to achieve the right result.

If you want to produce a webcast or webcast series at lower cost, you can select to produce it on your own. Make sure to have the right equipments and the right installation before doing so. Our support service will also be there to help you overcome obstacles if you run into problems.

### How to choose a webcasting platform. YouTube, LiveStream, plugin?

A webcast must be watched using a web interface, which, in the past, meant building an html page and embedding a plugin to distribute the stream to viewers. Some of these pages with their plugins were supplied by software platforms whose licenses could cost thousands of dollars. Today, these technologies are for the most part obsolete. In 2014, free or freemium platforms such as YouTube, UStream or Livestream offer an attractive alternative, but quickly become expensive and limiting when production needs scale up.

*Agence Webdiffusion* uses standard technologies that are compatible with the free platforms, but also chose to build its own platform using the latest generation of free and open source content management system software. The Drupal Webcasting platform is based on one of the most powerful web software frameworks, with a worldwide developer community of tens of thousands and many support and services providers with a proven track record, thus providing a *free and open source webcasting website*. Because we have integrated our own custom-designed configurations and modules, we are able to launch a webcasting project in less than a day, without modifying your organization's website, providing the peace of mind of a system that has a proven track record in live webcasting. And since it is designed for mobile-first layouts, our platform allows you to reach viewers no matter what device they use to view the webcast, from an iPad to a desktop computer.

### What kind of visual aid can be inserted into a webcast? How do we integrate a PowerPoint slide show into a webcast? Can we embed a Skype call into a webcast?

In traditional webcasting, the available bandwidth for the stream imposed a low-definition video stream which made it impossible to communicate detailed graphics. The fallback solution consisted of presenting a sequence of slides alongside the video, which forced the producer to synchronize slides during the live webcast. Some webcasting platforms in 2014 still employ this model, even though available bandwidth and improved compression technology makes high definition video streaming commonplace.

We chose to leave the entire space to the webcast featured speakers in our platform, and to integrate visual elements (which can now include slides as well as pre-produced videos or even a remote speaker through Skype or videoconferencing) using a live compositing setup managed by a streaming operator or switcher. Content is therefore much more dynamic and the burden to select what is relevant is reduced on both the viewer and the producer. Webcasting is made more enjoyable for everyone.

### How can a webcast look like a live television broadcast?

*A webcasting stage*

Technology complements professional talent, it does not substitute for it. To get the optimal results out of a pay-per-view webcast or a large-scale event we need to employ a professional production team to organize the artistic details of the webcast, led by a webcast director. We have often added a video director to our live webcast productions, and even assembled a team of video directors for large productions. The end result has been remarkable and is noticeable in the drama of the shots, the precision and skill of shot changes and the relevance of the accompanying graphics.

It must be said that adding a director to a webcast team increases the complexity of the organization and the planning required for the event. This usually means that a production coordinator will also be needed.

### What to do if my webcast audience is bilingual? How to live stream a bilingual webcast?

Bilingual webcasting is a challenge for many Canadian and international organizations and companies. The complexity this adds to webcast production is not so challenging as it seems, however. With a skilled translator in a standard translation booth, it is possible to transmit two soundstracks to a streaming server, and to transcode two webcast streams, one for viewers of each language. The webcast platform must link the two streams in a coherent way, which is easier said than done for freemium platforms like UStream or LiveStream, which are designed for an English mass-market. Our platform, Drupal Webcasting, is designed for deep multilingual support, and allows us to easily launch a bilingual webcast production.

If you wish to produce your bilingual webcast using subtitles instead of an audio translator, the process is similar. It requires an integration of the translation software and the live compositing software at the graphics layer of the webcast.

### What kind of streaming quality is possible in 2014?

The future is already here, but it is not evenly distributed. This means that, even though it is now straightforward to produce high definition webcasts using cloud computing and LTE mobile networks, webcast audiences are not uniformly wired with enough bandwidth to benefit from high definition. This is where transcoding servers, activated from the cloud only on the day of the webcast, are configured to create multiple stream qualities that are selected by the video player for the viewer based on their optimal viewing quality.

Even for viewers who have seen no increase in their available bandwidth for the past decade, improved *encoding* technology and the power of cloud computing have provided enormous progress in video quality. H.264 encoding, which was created specifically for web video, allows improved video quality without increasing necessary bandwidth. Everyone should be able to see an improvement.

### An alternative for visually-complex webcasts: pre-recorded green-screen webcasting

<!--![](http://placehold.it/960x540&text=Tournage+fond+vert)-->

If the featured presenters of your webcasts are a little shy or have a very complex presentation to make, some webcasting magic can come to their aid. A "green screen" shoot, combined with a programmed webcast or mixed webcast (part recorded, part live), allows your presenters to feel reduced pressure from a fully live webcast event, and also to exploit all the technical possibilities of green screens, such as integrating the presenter directly into his slides (imagine a TV weatherman in front of his radar map).
